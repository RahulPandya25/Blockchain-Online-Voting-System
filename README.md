# Blockchain-Online-Voting-System
The online voting system comprises of mainly 2 core concepts which are Blockchain and Cryptography. The general Idea is that - with each vote the blockchain ledger grows and the data of the user is encrypted and kept inside the block until the final voting results are made. The purpose of Blockchain is to have a reliable source of truth into our system and the purpose of cryptography is to hide the actual vote from the anyone trying to temper or view the actual ledger. Brief Implementation details involve two steps â€“ 1) encrypting vote and generating cipher text, 2) generating hash code from cipher text and adding this data to blockchain ledger. Once the voting process is completed, the actual data can be decrypted and made public.
